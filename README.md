# my-project

> A Vue.js project
## playing around and trying out vue js with:

- props
- components
- reference and primitive variables
- emit
- event bus

### Look Out! One Error Here

- Deliberately mutates props in Header and Footer Components
- So creates an anti-pattern in the changeTitle function
- can be solved with computed prop

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
